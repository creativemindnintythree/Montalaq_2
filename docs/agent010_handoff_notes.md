# Agent 010 Handoff Notes

## Overview
This document serves as the formal handoff record for Agent 010's responsibilities in the Montalaq_2 project. It covers the Rule Engine implementation, CSV bridge, integration points, and pending dependencies.

---

## Completed Work

### 1. Rule Engine Implementation
- **Stages Built:**
  - Stage 1.1 – Context (`stage_11_context.py`)
  - Stage 1.2 – Pattern Recognition (`stage_12_patterns.py`)
  - Stage 1.3 – Confirmation (`stage_13_confirmation.py`)
  - Stage 1.4 – Confluence (`stage_14_confluence.py`)
- **Engine Orchestration:** `engine.py`
  - Executes stages sequentially.
  - Applies weights from `constants.py`.
  - Determines final decision (`LONG`, `SHORT`, `NO_TRADE`).
  - Returns confidence score and stage-by-stage results.

### 2. Execution Logic
- **File:** `execution.py`
  - ATR-based Stop Loss / Take Profit calculation.
  - Uses `ATR_MULTIPLIER_SL` and `DEFAULT_RR_RATIO` from constants.
  - Structure in place for future structure-based SL/TP.

### 3. CSV Bridge for Testing
- **File:** `csv_marketdata_bridge.py`
  - Reads `focused_EURUSD.csv` from `outputs/`.
  - Normalizes OHLCV format to canonical schema.
  - Calculates 14-period ATR.
  - Outputs `market_dict` compatible with Rule Engine.
  - **TEMPORARY** — to be removed when Agent 012/013 ingestion pipeline is ready.

### 4. Pipeline Tester
- **File:** `pipeline_tester.py`
  - Integrates CSV bridge with Rule Engine and Execution.
  - Persists results to `TradeAnalysis` (CSV mode sets `market_data_feature=None`).
  - Validates end-to-end rule decision-making with live AllTick feed.

### 5. Database Model Updates
- **File:** `backend/models.py`
  - `TradeAnalysis` extended with:
    - `rule_confidence_score`
    - `final_decision`
    - Stage condition booleans
    - Optional metadata fields (e.g., `candlestick_pattern`).
  - Migrations applied successfully.

---

## Dependencies & Pending Items
- **Agent 012/013:** Replace CSV bridge with official ingestion → MarketDataFeatures pipeline.
- **Data Availability:** Current test mode bypasses MarketDataFeatures DB; production requires linking.
- **Patterns & Indicators:** Stage 1.2 and Stage 1.4 rules may need expansion for full strategy coverage.

## Handoff Status

- **Execution Logic:** ✅ Complete
- **CSV Bridge (Temporary):** ✅ Complete
- **DB Integration:** ✅ In test mode
- **Dependencies:** Awaiting ingestion pipeline from Agent 012/013

**End of Handoff – Agent 010** short

**To:** Agent 009 – Strategy Owner & Coordination Authority
**CC:** Agents 011, 012, 013
**From:** \[Your Name]
**Date:** 13-Aug-2025
**Subject:** Agent 010 – Handoff Readiness Confirmation

---

**Summary:**
Following the completion of Agent 010's implementation tasks, I am confirming readiness for handover and integration into the Montalaq\_2 operational pipeline.

---

### 1. Status Overview

Agent 010's scope (per *Agent 009 Strategy Directive & Agent 010–019 Operations* and *Focused Start Implementation Plan*) has been fulfilled. Deliverables include:

* **Rule-Based Analysis Engine** implementing Stages 1.1 – 1.4.
* **Weighted Scoring Logic** based on Phase 2/3 design.
* **SL/TP Calculation** using ATR-based methodology (documented in `sl_tp_methodology.md`).
* **TradeAnalysis Model Integration** for persistent storage of rule-based decisions and metadata.
* **CSV Bridge Adapter** (`csv_marketdata_bridge.py`) for temporary live-data testing via `focused_EURUSD.csv` until Agents 012/013 complete ingestion.
* **Documentation**: `rule_engine_weights.md`, `sl_tp_methodology.md`, `agent010_handoff_notes.md`, and mapping of CSV bridge fields.

---

### 2. Inter-Agent Dependencies & Notes

* **Agent 011 (ML Integration)**: Rule-based outputs are now stored in `TradeAnalysis` and can be accessed for composite score computation.
* **Agent 012 (Data Ingestion)**: The CSV bridge is temporary and must be replaced with the official ingestion loader. Mapping details are in `docs/csv_bridge_mapping.md`.
* **Agent 013 (Pipeline Orchestration)**: Rule engine is callable as a standalone function and integrated with `pipeline_tester.py`. Ready for Celery chain inclusion.

---

### 3. Outstanding Items / Risks

1. **Temporary Adapter** – Must be removed when Agents 012/013 deliver ingestion.
2. **Hardcoded Rule Weights** – Currently fixed in `constants.py`. Future adjustments should be coordinated through Agent 009.
3. **User Preferences Integration** – Default RR and ATR multipliers are hardcoded; Agent 014 will handle dynamic retrieval.

---

### 4. Recommendation

Agent 010 is clear for handover. I recommend immediate coordination with Agents 012 and 013 to:

* Validate data schema alignment between CSV bridge and MarketDataFeatures model.
* Test full pipeline from ingestion to rule analysis to ML scoring.
