Next Step Recommendation
Let’s now train a baseline ML model (like XGBoost) using these features.

Task: Build train_model.py to:
Load ML_ready_EURUSD.csv

Train/test split

Fit a regression model (predict target_return_5min)

Output:

Performance (MAE, MSE, R²)

Saved model (.pkl)

CSV with predictions

Would you like to proceed with that now? If yes, I’ll create the complete script from scratch.
