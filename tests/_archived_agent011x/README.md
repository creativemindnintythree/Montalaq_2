\# Archived Agent 011-x Tests (Quarantine)



These tests reference legacy ML batch runner (`ml.batch\_run\_recent`) and are out-of-scope for Agent 013.1.

Ownership: Agency 011 (HoA 009.3) with Agency 018 for validation.

Action: Rewrite/replace once 011 publishes the updated ML entrypoints and test contracts.



Do not delete until 011 confirms end-of-life or migration.
